# ai-face-detection
AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from digital images using python.

## Haar Cascade
An Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.

| Supervised learning (Human teaches it)                                        | Unsupervised learning (Computer teaches itself)                                                 |
